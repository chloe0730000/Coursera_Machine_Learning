## Course_1

* Cointegration indicates that the difference between the means of two price series is stationary (reverts to a long-term mean). A cointegrated series series can also be correlated but this is not required. 

* Correlation indicates that a price series has some relationship with another price series. This relationship can be very strong in the case of perfect positive (+1) or negative (-1) correlation or non-existent in the case of zero correlation.
